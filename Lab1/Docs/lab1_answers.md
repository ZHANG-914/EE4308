What are problem(s) that could occur, when...

1. The lookahead distance is too large?

   If the lookahead distance is too large, the robot will tend to cut corners or overshoot turns because it focuses on a point far ahead on the path, ignoring nearby deviations. And the robot may not follow the path closely, leading to large lateral deviations, especially in curved sections. In general, it is good for straight paths but poor for navigating tight curves or complex environments.


2. The lookahead distance is too small?

​	If the lookahead distance is too large, the robot will overreact to small changes in the path, causing it to oscillate or zigzag, 	especially at higher speeds, making the motion jerky and inefficient. Also frequent adjustments may require more processing 	power for control loops. In general, it is precise tracking in slow, careful navigation but poor performance at higher speeds or 	in smooth path-following scenarios.


3. The linear velocity is too large?

​	When the linear velocity is too large, the robot may not have enough time to react to path deviations, especially in tight 	   	curves, leading to path deviations or even collisions. High speed also reduces the time available for steering corrections,  	which may cause delayed or insufficient responses. Large linear velocity is suitable for long, straight paths but dangerous for 	complex or dynamic environments.


4. The lookahead point is to the left or right of the robot, such that $y' \approx 0$?

   Since the lateral offset y' is near zero, the calculated curvature will be small and cause minimal angular velocity. This will result in the robot maintaining a nearly straight trajectory and might miss the turn. 


5. The lookahead point is behind the robot, such that $x' < 0$?

   When the lookahead point is behind the robot, the robot will attempt an extremely turning, the control logic may produce large angular velocities, the robot may spin in place or behave unpredictablely, leading to oscillation or even loss of paths.
