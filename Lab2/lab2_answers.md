1. Determine the expression for $a_{z,k}$.

2. What are the matrix / vector sizes for $\mathbf{H}$, the innovation, the innovation covariance, and $\mathbf{K}$?

3. In order to determine $\sigma_{snr,z}^2$, one way is to make the drone stationary and collect about 100 samples from the sonar sensor and determine the variance from the samples. 
However, the drone may slowly drift upwards. 
In this situation, concisely describe your process of determining $\sigma_{snr,z}^2$ by using a best fit line and further tuning. An essay is **not** expected for this answer.
